Chess
=====

This is an open-source project. My goal is to create a chess program that can be used to display previous games through a PGN file and be used to setup custom board scenarios so users can practice more effectively.

This will be coding using Processing. With that in mind I would like to add some visual flare to the program as well.

Feel free contribute or download the code for yourself.
